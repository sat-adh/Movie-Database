Make sure you are in the right directory before you run the server.
	You should see \md_api as the last thing in the path inside your terminal.
	All the code files are inside of the md_api subfolder.

To install all dependencies:
	Type: npm install
	You should now see a node_modules folder

To run the server:
	Type: node server.js
	Ctrl + Click on the link in the terminal that says 'Server listening at ...' 
	This will send you to the login page, which is the starting point of the program.

You can search for movies from the search input field from their titles only. 
If you want to search movies based on genre or actor, try through query params:
	/MDAPI/movies?genre=___
	/MDAPI/movies?actor=___
	/MDAPI/movies?title=___
